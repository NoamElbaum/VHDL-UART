# VHDL-UART
UART protocol in VHDL to communicate between altera de0nano and a pc or any other UART compatible device
The 3 vhdl file are all you need to create the UART communication block. corrently the code is adjusted to work with the altera de0nano but in order to change it all you need to do is change the SW input from 4 bit to 8 bit and then you can send any akue you want 

baud rate: 9600
parity: none
bits of data: 8
stop bits: 1
